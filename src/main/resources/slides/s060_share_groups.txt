Share groups:

1. consumer sends a heartbeat to the group coordinator
2. group coordinator assigns a number of share-partitions (`SimpleAssignor`)

✅ these partitions are *not* exclusive
✅ no fencing required - temporary fluctuations possible

New components, managed by the broker, with in-memory views:
⭐️ group coordinator (co-located with the leader of `__consumer_offsets`)
⭐️ share coordinator (co-located with the leader of `__share_group_state`)
⭐️ share-partition leader
