Share groups:

⭐️ special topic (`__consumer_offsets` && `__share_group_state`) to store group state
⭐️ at-least once or at-most-once

⚠️ no ordering (even per-partition)
⚠️ concurrent consumption possible
   + `acquired` state not persisted - as in consumer groups
⚠️ no DLQ
⚠️ no delayed delivery
❓ performance

✅️ selective commits
✅️ unbounded parallelism
✅️ no fencing events
✅️ head-of-line-blocking possibly solved - given enough consumers
✅️ upcoming integration with transactions
