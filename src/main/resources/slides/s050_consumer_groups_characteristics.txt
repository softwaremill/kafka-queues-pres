Consumer groups:

⭐️ special topic (`__consumer_offsets`) to store consumed offsets
⭐️ at-least once or at-most-once

⚠️ up-to-offset commits
⚠️ parallelism limited by number of partitions
⚠️ fencing events (rebalancing)
⚠️ concurrent consumption still possible
⚠️ head-of-line blocking

✅️ ordered consumption per-partition
✅️ integrated with transactions
✅ low communication overhead
✅ high performance
