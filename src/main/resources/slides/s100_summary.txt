In summary:

✅️ share groups join consumer groups as a collaborative consumption option
⭐️ new stateful, broker-managed components
⚠️ share groups are not production ready yet
✅️ share groups offer individual message acknowledgment, but with caveats
✅️ unbounded parallelism
✅️ possible solution to head-of-line blocking
✅️ expected high performance

🐰 MQ systems still have an edge (RabbitMQ, Artemis):
   - routing (direct, fanout)
   - delayed delivery, message priorities
   - includes messaging patterns such as request/reply
   - DLQs
