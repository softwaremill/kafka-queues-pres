Consumer groups:
⭐️ collaborative consumption
⭐️ partitions: also a unit of consumption

If a topic has 9 partitions and 4 consumers in a single group:
consumer1: 0, 3, 5
consumer2: 1, 4
consumer3: 2, 7
consumer4: 8, 6

After a consumer leaves, rebalancing occurs:
consumer1: 0, 3, 5
consumer2: 1, 4, 8
consumer3: 2, 7, 6
